                <h2> Exploring trends between census features for different states</h2>
                <h3>Design considerations: </h3>
                <p class='considerations'>
                    I wanted to explore trends between each pair of progress metrics. A scatterplot was perfect to identify trends over ranges because it allows for perception of direction. In this visualization, the user can pick the variable they want to represent on the X-axis, Y-axis and the states they want to view the data for. Each  circle represents one district. Circles are color coded by state. The area of each circle reflects the population of the district. This was done to allow the user to explore two other trends at the same time while understanding how populations were distributed instead of just how districts are distributed. Circles have a black stroke because it is difficult to tell the boundaries of the circles shaded with light colors. Light colors had to be used because 35 different colors were needed to code for states and union territories. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="considerations">
                    The X-axis and Y-axis variables have the same controls i.e. a feature of the data. This is to give the user complete control of features to visualize. They can only select one feature at a time for each axis. Choosing from a list was the simplest way to present such a large collection of features. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="considerations">
                    Some columns were removed from the options because a lot of data points were missing or were NA. Other columns were removed because they were not numeric and could not be well represented with a scatterplot i.e. in the same form as the other columns. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="considerations">
                     In the state selection, however, they can select multiple states at the same time. This allows them to compare values and explore trends for the same metrics across different states while allowing them to identify outlying districts. For some states with long names, abbreviations were used. Most users from India, however, would be well versed with the abbreviations and would prefer the colloquial term.
